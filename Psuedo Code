1. Load image paths, extract labels, and store in a DataFrame.
2. Split the DataFrame into training and testing sets.
3. Load and preprocess images for training and testing:
    - Either use ImageDataGenerator or load images manually using load_img.
    - Resize and normalize images.
4. Encode labels using LabelEncoder and to_categorical.
5. Create a CNN model using Sequential, adding layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense.
6. Compile the model with an optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
7. Train the model using model.fit on the training data and validate with the testing data.
8. Evaluate the model's performance using model.evaluate and classification_report.
9. Save the trained model to a file using model.save.
10. Load the saved model using load_model when needed.
